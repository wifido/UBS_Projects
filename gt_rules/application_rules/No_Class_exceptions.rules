	# be turned on, to enable better examination of the event stream. These settings will
	# assist in developing more meaningful rules sets. In the interests of preventing a storm
	# dragging down the Object Server, these events will over deduplicate. This will not be
	# an issue once a few events have been recieved, and more appropriate include.rules exist.
	# After the first time this section of rules has been used, it is likely that the
	# following rules will need to be embedded in some form of switch or if statement.
