Thoughts about UBS DBaaS Monitoring

We need to Identify:
	Events to be Monitored
		OEM
		Databases
			alerts and job status


				•The following components (And more) can be monitored using Enterprise Manager
				•Databases hosts
				•Exadata Cells
				•Cisco switch
				•KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse)
				•ILOM Monitoring
				•Infiniband switch
				•Power distribution unit (PDU)
		
		For this we need latest MiB
		Check latest rules
		how do we interface with SLOW
		how do we enrich events from CMDB (atrium)
		can we get some raw capture for OEM4 Events
		can we use a right click tool to access MyOracle support KB
		
	Dashboard Design Requirements
		Business Goals
		User requirements
			Define target audience
			Core user requirements
			Core user wishes
			Task analysis
			size of page?
		Review Process
