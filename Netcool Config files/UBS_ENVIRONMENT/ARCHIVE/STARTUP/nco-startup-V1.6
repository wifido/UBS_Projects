# UBS generic startup script 
# Operating systems tested against
#	Linux AS 2.1 3.0
#	Solaris 2.8
#
# Author: Gary Thomas
# Date:  27th September 2007
# Version: 1.6
# Change log.
# 1.6 - GT Modified CHOWN,CHGRP and CHMOD statements for PA logfiles.
# 1.5 - GT Added -authenticate PAM argument to nco_pad command for LDAP testing.
# 1.4 - GT Added logic to cat /dev/null to pa_child.log and NCO_PA.log, setting ownership to netcool/NCO_Superuser.
# 1.3 - GT Added -killprocessgroup to nco_pad command to test remedy gateway.
# 1.2 - GT Added logic to copy away pa_child.log and NCO_PA.log if they exist.
# 1.1 - GT Added section to identify if this script is running as root or a member of NCO_Superuser netgroup.

# Script starts here.
# Variables that can be changed

# To enable debug logging for NCO_PA set the PA_DEBUG variable to 1
# To disable the debug logging set PA_DEBUG variable to 0
