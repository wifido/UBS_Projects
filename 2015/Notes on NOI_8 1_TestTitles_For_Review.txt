Notes on NOI_8 1_TestTitles_For_Review

Initial comments

	Document should be in SharePoint
	Like tests should be grouped, for example all the probe functionality tests should be grouped, that way they don't get duplicated and it's easier to check that nothing gets missed
	
	Each integration should have it's own tab or be grouped together in one tab, don't see 
		Agent heartbeating, 
		Agent Status
		Application Heartbeating
		TBSM - this should be integrated with the TBSM testing
		ITM - needs to be integrated with ITM testing
		and on for all the other integrations
		
		These tests should include all OS triggers, Impact Policies and scripts for a given integration
		
	There should be a tab for architecture testing
		this should include but not be limited to
		Normal functioning
		Component Version
		Correct component Logging
		Failover testing
		Process Control
		Rules/Lookup pushes

	3/5	you cant check Collection with webgui
